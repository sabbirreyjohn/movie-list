Here are the implementation details

1. The demo project is implemented such a way that it is scalable and extendable in future releases.
2. Latest Jetpack compose is used to develop the UI which reduces the implementation speed by getting rid of fragments and improved performance.
3. Dagger Hilt is used for dependency injection library.
4. Room persistance library is used for local database management and store data locally.
5. MVVM architectural pattern used with google provided jetpack library and viewModel.
